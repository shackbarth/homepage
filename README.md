Gettysburg
==========

Roll your own humble CMS because down with the corporate establishment etc.
Powered by markdown, express, and skrollr.

## Another static site generator?

Why not? Gettysburg's operating principle is, _everything is easy now_. [Server configuration](),
[content processing](), [HTML templating](), [stylesheeting](), [dependency management](),
[documentation](): that's all you need, and none of these need to take more than a screenful of code anymore.

## How does it work

Just put your markdown files in the `content` folder, and add some images by
the same name in the `public/images` folder, add some page-specific stylesheets (if you have to) 
in the `public/stylesheets` folder, and the site builds itself.

Gettysburg will elevate the first two lines of each markdown file as the title and the subtitle.

## What does it look like?

Here's a site [built with Gettysburg](). The specific content is deployed from a [branch]() of a 
[framework-only master](), which is how you should do it if you want to contribute back framework
code.

## How should I deploy it

Just use Heroku.

## How can my audience give me comments or +1's or Pinterest etcetera?

No.
