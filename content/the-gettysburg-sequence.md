# The Gettysburg Sequence

(July 1 - 2 - 3, 1863)

Numbers blur; there's a lie under them, in the teeth of an old saw. By Armistice Day in New England, rock maples, one by one, stand skeletons; their erstwhile blaze waits out wind or broom-rake unto oblivion. A leaf, overtaken of a breezeless forenoon, poses, slips, and glides see-saw turfward. It billets you or me.

Legion undone, tallysome though, pocked the meadows, bogs, and bosks roundabout the nodding town of tanners, cobblers, and saddlers. Why Gettysburg? Well, because Brigadier Johnston Pettigrew of Major General Harry Heth's Division, attached to Lieutenant General Ambrose Powell Hill's III Corps, in General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia fancied shoes -- not just for himself. He besought, properly enough, the General's go-ahead; Heth, eschewing channels, assented. Such seeming-unfraught whim committed Mr. Davis, 180 mile distant their shopping spree. Said coy contract, bodeing more than it chattered, Major General John F. Reynolds, I Corps, Army of The Potomac, counter-signed instanter. The fee came a small fortune though... himself's mortality, ninety seconds upon arrival the Union defense line tight Willoughby Run. A Mississippi marksman, discerning an epaulet, undid one highly competent Pennsylvania soldierman. Just like that. Pettigrew horned assorted foot-gear all right, Heth wore an hole in the soul, Longstreet didn't quite fit, Lee was saddled to the wrong mount.

Thomas Jonathan Jackson did not attend; John Buford did. J. E. B. Stuart shew tardy; John Buford was waiting, astraddle.

Mr. Hemingway has scrawled the hippocratic arithmetic sufficeing terse for Quill: "The valid statistic is one (1)." Only moons back, Johnny and Jack graced their respective kitchens: worrying pigloins at Roanoke, brine-beef at Chelsea; swilling cider, cameling porter; gameing their women in oestrus. Now, one at a time, find Johnny Frye, tag Jack Prendergast. Never. That be absolute, Dr. Einstein or no.

Women (chaste or riggish, what matter?), waiting remote the cauldron, made do, got by on wintersleep, and aged. Still: spank kitchen, groom bairns to school, swab baby's bum and promise. Who's to undertake pronunciamentos? Where quaysi Death puts up, calipres and stethescopes count nothing.

Time near hand, Quill abode hardby Dublin and Edinburgh. At Solomonic fingering he assays matrices and castings treasure thereabout. The apposite styles graze, they don't bump. Dublin, nimble, Swiftian; Edinburgh, painstaking, Smithlike. Wharfing a sentient sea-farer, Yank at that, they grimaced, but jettisoned a few entries in the tired log. In keeping, the clans lent him sporadic ingress their pow-wows. If he sorted traits and tics; if he turned bias along the potter-wheels weather, terrain, pinch or groaning board; if he reckoned incongruities back to tamper-mechanics of dispossession and out-breeding under the pounces and genitalia of successive usurpers, he was at least talking Celt turkey. And because he buttressed his surmise, often as not ever needing utterance, with a goodly smattering of either island's overt and/or clandestine scrapes along history -- surges and setbacks -- Mac's and O's came sluggish to trust him, within bounds... as it should be.

All right, so much for west-east. East-west? Another yarn. Quill winced, at times, that so witted islanders as Celts proved out so lethargic, stony, when the mere matter pertained The United States of Purgatory, panaorama of Paradise, large scale chart of Gehanna. There's more than one irish bank vice-president who can put finger on G. Washington, taps grand excitement gawking General Custer, Sitting Bull rendezvous at the Telly, or imparts the arcane lore that Kennedys hearthed County Wexford whilst Fitzgeralds sprang The West. Midlothian solicitors abound who revere Alexander Graham Bell, envy Uncle Same manna because Dr. Albert Einstein turned up abandoned at his door-sill, confide their nation bestowed on General Eisenhower a castle with moat... and golf course. Abigail Adams? "Sorra, you'll need to explicate." (Jaysusgod, and She statured thrice the woman Mary Stuart dreamt upstairs or craved below.) To be sure, Quill, by bent, seldom haunted the academic, bohemian, or clerical ring-around-the-rosy cabals. He muscled his milieu on men-in-commerce, builder-architects, the Military, their wives and/or lemans that tagged along, drunks threatening give-and-take, publicans who slaked them. But still.




### The Gettysburg Sequence #1
Epilogue  
(The Gesture Day......November 19, 1863)

Mr. Lincoln catnaps to the anodynous clacking of his Reading coach, closeing on Gettysburg. He tallies random inward and outward accounts. Does the President graze you a mite sorry for Abe? Well, does not the Son of Man for Jesus, urgeing a gibbet to its ordained rearing?

    Pa whimped. Ma whored to whelp Abe hedgerow snatch?
    Mary hugs light to shadow black Xantipp',
    The moot-to-matter boys -- his kitchen catch.
    Least, dirksome friends! He bodes Knight Lee dark trip.
    (He's sound: one county's brim each man will stand).
    Not mine, because he loved Westmoreland more
    Than Lincoln's shire. Chill God, he's seared a brand
    Aswash all History that's hapt... foul sore,
    Ubiquitous as syphilis. To post?
    Mere Lee. He's up to Grant and with his two friends.
    The sun arcs plane: Abe's sapped, cert as thug Frost
    Had caned his pipes. Celled pate but turnkey tends.
      Abe, sugar-plumb the folks. They yearn a fruit.
      But Springfield mockingbird, he tends thy flute.
