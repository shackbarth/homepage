# The Gettysburg Sequence

## Proem
(July 1 - 2 - 3, 1863)

Numbers blur; there's a lie under them, in the teeth of an old saw. By Armistice Day in New England, rock maples, one by one, stand skeletons; their erstwhile blaze waits out wind or broom-rake unto oblivion. A leaf, overtaken of a breezeless forenoon, poses, slips, and glides see-saw turfward. It billets you or me.

Legion undone, tallysome though, pocked the meadows, bogs, and bosks roundabout the nodding town of tanners, cobblers, and saddlers. Why Gettysburg? Well, because Brigadier Johnston Pettigrew of Major General Harry Heth's Division, attached to Lieutenant General Ambrose Powell Hill's III Corps, in General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia fancied shoes -- not just for himself. He besought, properly enough, the General's go-ahead; Heth, eschewing channels, assented. Such seeming-unfraught whim committed Mr. Davis, 180 mile distant their shopping spree. Said coy contract, bodeing more than it chattered, Major General John F. Reynolds, I Corps, Army of The Potomac, counter-signed instanter. The fee came a small fortune though... himself's mortality, ninety seconds upon arrival the Union defense line tight Willoughby Run. A Mississippi marksman, discerning an epaulet, undid one highly competent Pennsylvania soldierman. Just like that. Pettigrew horned assorted foot-gear all right, Heth wore an hole in the soul, Longstreet didn't quite fit, Lee was saddled to the wrong mount.

### The Gettysburg Sequence #1
Epilogue  
(The Gesture Day......November 19, 1863)

Mr. Lincoln catnaps to the anodynous clacking of his Reading coach, closeing on Gettysburg. He tallies random inward and outward accounts. Does the President graze you a mite sorry for Abe? Well, does not the Son of Man for Jesus, urgeing a gibbet to its ordained rearing?

    Pa whimped. Ma whored to whelp Abe hedgerow snatch?
    Mary hugs light to shadow black Xantipp',
    The moot-to-matter boys -- his kitchen catch.
    Least, dirksome friends! He bodes Knight Lee dark trip.
    (He's sound: one county's brim each man will stand).
    Not mine, because he loved Westmoreland more
    Than Lincoln's shire. Chill God, he's seared a brand
    Aswash all History that's hapt... foul sore,
    Ubiquitous as syphilis. To post?
    Mere Lee. He's up to Grant and with his two friends.
    The sun arcs plane: Abe's sapped, cert as thug Frost
    Had caned his pipes. Celled pate but turnkey tends.
      Abe, sugar-plumb the folks. They yearn a fruit.
      But Springfield mockingbird, he tends thy flute.
