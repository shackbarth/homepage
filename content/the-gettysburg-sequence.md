# The Gettysburg Sequence

_The Gettysburg Sequence was written by American poet Carl Franck, alias Mike Quill, in 1972._

### Proem
(July 1 - 2 - 3, 1863)

Numbers blur; there's a lie under them, in the teeth of an old saw. By Armistice Day in New England, rock maples, one by one, stand skeletons; their erstwhile blaze waits out wind or broom-rake unto oblivion. A leaf, overtaken of a breezeless forenoon, poses, slips, and glides see-saw turfward. It billets you or me.

Legion undone, tallysome though, pocked the meadows, bogs, and bosks roundabout the nodding town of tanners, cobblers, and saddlers. Why Gettysburg? Well, because Brigadier Johnston Pettigrew of Major General Harry [Heth's](#Heth) Division, attached to Lieutenant General Ambrose Powell Hill's III Corps, in General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia fancied shoes -- not just for himself. He besought, properly enough, the General's go-ahead; Heth, eschewing channels, assented. Such seeming-unfraught whim committed Mr. Davis, 180 mile distant their shopping spree. Said coy contract, bodeing more than it chattered, Major General John F. Reynolds, I Corps, Army of The Potomac, counter-signed instanter. The fee came a small fortune though... himself's mortality, ninety seconds upon arrival the Union defense line tight Willoughby Run. A Mississippi marksman, discerning an epaulet, undid one highly competent Pennsylvania soldierman. Just like that. Pettigrew horned assorted foot-gear all right, Heth wore an hole in the soul, Longstreet didn't quite fit, Lee was saddled to the wrong mount.

Thomas Jonathan Jackson did not attend; John Buford did. J. E. B. Stuart shew tardy; John Buford was waiting, astraddle.

Mr. Hemingway has scrawled the hippocratic arithmetic sufficeing terse for Quill: "The valid statistic is one (1)." Only moons back, Johnny and Jack graced their respective kitchens: worrying pigloins at Roanoke, brine-beef at Chelsea; swilling cider, cameling porter; gameing their women in oestrus. Now, one at a time, find Johnny Frye, tag Jack Prendergast. Never. That be absolute, Dr. Einstein or no.

Women (chaste or riggish, what matter?), waiting remote the cauldron, made do, got by on wintersleep, and aged. Still: spank kitchen, groom [bairns](#Bairn) to school, swab baby's bum and promise. Who's to undertake pronunciamentos? Where quaysi Death puts up, calipres and stethescopes count nothing.

Time near hand, Quill abode hardby Dublin and Edinburgh. At Solomonic fingering he assays matrices and castings treasure thereabout. The apposite styles graze, they don't bump. Dublin, nimble, Swiftian; Edinburgh, painstaking, Smithlike. Wharfing a sentient sea-farer, Yank at that, they grimaced, but jettisoned a few entries in the tired log. In keeping, the clans lent him sporadic ingress their pow-wows. If he sorted traits and tics; if he turned [bias](#Bias) along the potter-wheels weather, terrain, pinch or groaning board; if he reckoned incongruities back to tamper-mechanics of dispossession and out-breeding under the pounces and genitalia of successive usurpers, he was at least talking Celt turkey. And because he buttressed his surmise, often as not ever needing utterance, with a goodly smattering of either island's overt and/or clandestine scrapes along history -- surges and setbacks -- Mac's and O's came sluggish to trust him, within bounds... as it should be.

All right, so much for west-east. East-west? Another yarn. Quill winced, at times, that so witted islanders as Celts proved out so lethargic, stony, when the mere matter pertained The United States of Purgatory, panaorama of Paradise, large scale chart of Gehanna. There's more than one irish bank vice-president who can put finger on G. Washington, taps grand excitement gawking General Custer, Sitting Bull rendezvous at the Telly, or imparts the arcane lore that Kennedys hearthed County Wexford whilst Fitzgeralds sprang The West. Midlothian solicitors abound who revere Alexander Graham Bell, envy Uncle Same manna because Dr. Albert Einstein turned up abandoned at his door-sill, confide their nation bestowed on General Eisenhower a castle with moat... and golf course. Abigail Adams? "Sorra, you'll need to explicate." (Jaysusgod, and She statured thrice the woman Mary Stuart dreamt upstairs or craved below.) To be sure, Quill, by bent, seldom haunted the academic, bohemian, or clerical ring-around-the-rosy cabals. He muscled his milieu on men-in-commerce, builder-architects, the Military, their wives and/or lemans that tagged along, drunks threatening give-and-take, publicans who slaked them. But still.

Stateside? Same poor show, less amnesty Quill's stricture. The germane verb spells no longer wince; it scans scorn on peers his age or less or more, and some scope wider far. No moral indictment. Nastier: sluggard stance, unstyle. Desuetude yawns for Taps? A balm, an easement, nemine gratia, and instant gentlemen won't stand attention its Benison once a night, once a death, once a nation? Hale, drones of necropolis! New Bedford blood, Front Royal lymph, spilt all right, stains not your tufted wall-to-wall carpeting. Your Martini runneth over, Sir.

Just so. Rancour prompted the fourteen poems; humbleness before sustained them, such as they be. (Small fibbings? Well, a Kerryman will squander ninety-nine lies to get one fact across.) What burthen they lug? Patently into middle age, he would now decrypt the lode into Quillese, then chance the effluvia at the alter of Merciless Mother English. As he's stared and mulled downside The Angle hardby the clump of trees, between the Codori cote abnd barn, across the Emmitsburg road, past The Swale, into Spangler's Wood he partly pieces together, like a [dhobi](#Dhobi) gathering remnants of a shattered crock and hopelessly findering them, how he, you, and the yearling nation died... and under whose auspices:  
  Abraham Lincoln  
  Robert E. Lee  
  Traveller  
  John Burns  
  Jennie Wren  
  Henry Lee  
  George Meade  
  Arno Kiesewetter  
  Father Corby  
  John Sedgewick  
  Lewis Armistead  
  Ian Farquharson  
  Ulysses S. Grant  
  Sarah Carter  

Tattoo... Taps. Eyes dry, sweep down Glory's roster again for Domesday's sake. Go ahead, murmur: "But Glory shew on and on -- Wake Island, Bastogne, Tarawa, Huertgen Forest." Other times, other Glories: Glories of stock, Glories in season. Glory of the maples, October's afternoon; Glorious the seared beech, defying December to undress first. Twin Glories: Gettysburg, Guadalcanal... The Glory of life passing into death, the Glory of death passing for life.

Mr. Yeats blasphemed shrewd when he owned up that Sex and Death loomed the two contingencies bloody well worth his bother. Aye, Mr. Yeats. Still, you stem County Sligo gentry; Mike Quill, maker of these sonnets, septs The O'Suileabhain Kerry fisherfolk. His leaning? Deserving the japer; sex, death, god, pieces o' eight, booze, power. Perhaps he can move on, one day, along more indigenous vein. For now, sex and death. War? Not quite. Gettysburg sums them one.

### The Gettysburg Sequence #1
Epilogue  
(The Gesture Day... November 19, 1863)

Mr. Lincoln catnaps to the anodynous clacking of his Reading coach, closeing on Gettysburg. He tallies random inward and outward accounts. Does the President graze you a mite sorry for Abe? Well, does not the Son of Man for Jesus, urgeing a gibbet to its ordained rearing?

>Pa whimped. Ma whored to whelp Abe hedgerow snatch?  
>Mary hugs light to shadow black Xantipp',  
>The moot-to-matter boys -- his kitchen catch.  
>Least, [dirksome](#Dirksome) friends! He bodes Knight _Lee_ dark trip.  
>(_He's_ sound: one county's brim each man will stand).  
>Not mine, because he loved Westmoreland more  
>Than Lincoln's shire. Chill God, he's seared a brand  
>Aswash all History that's hapt... foul sore,  
>Ubiquitous as syphilis. To post?  
>Mere _Lee_. _He's_ up to Grant and with his two friends.  
>The sun arcs plane: Abe's sapped, cert as thug Frost  
>Had caned his pipes. Celled pate but turnkey tends.  
>Abe, sugar-plumb the folks. They yearn a fruit.  
>But Springfield mockingbird, he tends thy flute.

### The Gettysburg Sequence #2
(The First Day... July 1, 1863)

Robert E. Lee ambles Traveller. The Engineer talks shop and saddle with his sentient engine. The colloquy courses tacit, muted.

Neat, [anabolism](#Anabolism), nibble at the man's fibre... and compounded, two of those three precarious days, by an acute [flux](#Flux); DUTY, as in the past, reports to headquarters. But where intransient ordeal lies doggo to haze, the General will henceforth be taxed over and beyond ITS call. Overload chose noon to weigh in.

Lee speaks:

"Now, no choice but maul the hour. This day? Well, common-sense has written Jackson off. But Stuart? Carlisle's an healthy canter, fetch yesterday. That can abide the [exemplars-to-come](#Exemplars) at West Point... or Lexington.

First the mete, Brevet Liuetenant Lee: erase Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville -- too lucky, too much Stonewall... and postures upended. (What's more, Old Whiskers and Fightin' Joe patently liveried us those twin gory aliments.) Today's algebra? Meade + Sedgewick + stores - Jackson (Have I discounted Stonewall, in truth?), compounded to an escaped power by Stuart = Lee over x. Moot mathematic. And if the tangency disjoin with no [apodosis](#Apodosis)? Well then, Alexander's dread! For five mountain spines and four rivers to west and south, Mr. Lincoln stays his hand with one ace and two jacks showing, and something in the hole. Capt. Lee knows his hand: two kinds showing."

Withal, a good man plumb purest to the Traveller, or Rover, that matches his master... body, heart, and brain.

>I heed [The Snapper](#Snapper), h'm, Monterey it was.  
>He miened moot rusy, surfeit stanch. I think,  
>Tight score, we'll squeeze him though. He never does  
>Much quake... less foray 'field. An I claw drink  
>Swish Grant to west (God wits Lee patent can't.)  
>I'd sough things out the stretch. Or had I had  
>Light Horse spell gadding Jeb, his stores could scant.  
>How deem y' Traveller? Lee's wrought, he's glad,  
>His other self, to mount your splendid side.  
>Since Stonewall fell, y've not once stumbled gait --  
>My trove, trade Jackson's loss. Rain friend, my pride  
>That our Westmoreland foal the steady trait.  
>I mull Hill, Longstreet, Ewel... puzzles three;  
>I grope: they're mine to fumble with as key.

### The Gettysburg Sequence #3
(The First Day... July 1, 1863)

Auld John Burns, [souter](#Souter), stands ready, wheat to the midriff, sighting west.

>Och, three-score-ten o'rifled, tendin' me!  
>I ken grey gooshin' doon yon green defile  
>I'll size the pownied [ghaistie](#Ghaistie), Lee, th' day  
>An' fling thae Cavalier the' sco'ish style  
>Fell Ulster clans romp rude, bu' doona frigh'  
>Ilk Borders Sco'. Och forbears mine wi' Bruce  
>An' Wallace bled. Di' pauky Caesar try  
>T' [hough](#Hough) our [hames an' haughs](#Hames and Haughs)? Na he! The truce  
>He kep', where Sassunach fronts ither shame --  
>Fu' wa' that looms until this awfu' day.  
>'Side me, wee Kerkimer, whose tacit fame  
>Be water he will tak bricht lad who dee  
>'Ere sun gang doon. Och, aye, this day the [bairns](#Bairn)  
>Maun keep [hie](#Hie) companie we' cronie Burns.

### Wordstock

Riddles, sobriquets, foreign or densely dialectal terms, coined words, etc. are keyed by _number_ (#) to their incidence throughout The Sequence. For example, PAWKY, canny, wary, Sc. #3. Now, that simply means that the Scottish word _pawky_ occurs in Sonnet #3 (or its attendant prose) and suggests the foregoing familiar-English meanings.

Routine abbreviations are the established ones found in any good English dictionary. To wit: Sc.=Scottish, Path.=Pathology, Intr.=intransitive use of verb, Heb.=Hebrew, and so forth. A few idiosyncratic signals are employed: Q/M=Quillmint (an homemade locution), or T/Y/M/G=Thank you, Mother Goose, etc.

The import of italics is threefold: (1) Conventionally, to convey emphasis and/or affect the flow of diction. (2) To certify a non-English word -- Hindi, Latin, et al. (Exception: Poem #3, built in unabashed "Borders-Scots" inflection). (3) Pronominally, as in #1, where Mr. Lincoln and Gen'l Lee are evoked contrapuntally. The device delines the one man (Mr. Lincoln) from _the other_ (Gen'l. Lee).

The Wordstock swanks no condescension; Quill avowedly surmises, and _respects_, random gaps in a given reader's encyclopaedic inventory. Moreover, let the stateside person allow that a schooled Scots, Irish, Welsh, or English compeer should not be expected to command scope (Lord Charnwood, Sir Winston Churchill, Lt. Gen'l Sir James Marshall-Cornwall excepted) rangeing over persons, places, and contingencies bearing on the conflict broadly and the Gettysburg holocaust in particualr with the grasp of a middle-aged American, high school trained. (The same fetter might well hobble a stateside Ph. D., Soc. of _instant_ vintage.)
