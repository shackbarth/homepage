# The Gettysburg Sequence

_This previously unpublished work was written by American poet Carl Franck, alias Mike Quill, in 1972._

### Proem
(July 1 - 2 - 3, 1863)

Numbers blur; there's a lie under them, in the teeth of an [old saw](#Old Saw). By Armistice Day in New England, [rock maples](#Rock Maple), one by one, stand skeletons; their erstwhile blaze waits out wind or broom-rake unto oblivion. A leaf, overtaken of a breezeless forenoon, poses, slips, and glides see-saw turfward. It billets you or me.

Legion undone, tallysome though, pocked the meadows, bogs, and bosks roundabout the nodding town of tanners, cobblers, and saddlers. Why Gettysburg? Well, because Brigadier Johnston Pettigrew of Major General Harry [Heth's](#Heth) Division, attached to Lieutenant General Ambrose Powell Hill's III Corps, in General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia fancied shoes -- not just for himself. He besought, properly enough, the General's go-ahead; Heth, eschewing channels, assented. Such seeming-unfraught whim committed Mr. Davis, 180 mile distant their shopping spree. Said coy contract, bodeing more than it chattered, Major General John F. [Reynolds](#Reynolds), I Corps, Army of The Potomac, counter-signed instanter. The fee came a small fortune though... himself's mortality, ninety seconds upon arrival the Union defense line tight Willoughby Run. A Mississippi marksman, discerning an epaulet, undid one highly competent Pennsylvania soldierman. Just like that. Pettigrew horned assorted foot-gear all right, Heth wore an hole in the soul, Longstreet didn't quite fit, Lee was saddled to the wrong mount.

Thomas Jonathan Jackson did not attend; John Buford did. J. E. B. Stuart shew tardy; John Buford was waiting, astraddle.

Mr. Hemingway has scrawled the hippocratic arithmetic sufficeing terse for Quill: "The valid statistic is one (1)." Only moons back, [Johnny and Jack](#Johnny and Jack) graced their respective kitchens: worrying pigloins at Roanoke, brine-beef at Chelsea; swilling cider, cameling porter; gameing their women in oestrus. Now, one at a time, find Johnny Frye, tag Jack Prendergast. Never. That be absolute, Dr. Einstein or no.

Women (chaste or riggish, what matter?), waiting remote the cauldron, made do, got by on wintersleep, and aged. Still: spank kitchen, groom [bairns](#Bairn) to school, swab baby's bum and promise. Who's to undertake pronunciamentos? Where quaysi Death puts up, calipres and stethescopes count nothing.

Time near hand, Quill abode hardby Dublin and Edinburgh. At Solomonic fingering he assays matrices and castings treasure thereabout. The apposite styles graze, they don't bump. Dublin, nimble, [Swiftian](#Swiftian); Edinburgh, painstaking, [Smithlike](#Smithlike). Wharfing a sentient sea-farer, Yank at that, they grimaced, but jettisoned a few entries in the tired log. In keeping, the clans lent him sporadic ingress their pow-wows. If he sorted traits and tics; if he turned [bias](#Bias) along the potter-wheels weather, terrain, pinch or groaning board; if he reckoned incongruities back to tamper-mechanics of dispossession and out-breeding under the [pounces](#Pounces) and genitalia of successive usurpers, he was at least talking Celt turkey. And because he buttressed his surmise, often as not ever needing utterance, with a goodly smattering of either island's overt and/or clandestine scrapes along history -- surges and setbacks -- Mac's and O's came sluggish to trust him, within bounds... as it should be.

All right, so much for west-east. East-west? Another yarn. Quill winced, at times, that so witted islanders as Celts proved out so lethargic, stony, when the mere matter pertained The United States of Purgatory, panaorama of Paradise, large scale chart of Gehanna. There's more than one irish bank vice-president who can put finger on G. Washington, taps grand excitement gawking General Custer, Sitting Bull rendezvous at the [Telly](#Telly), or imparts the arcane lore that Kennedys hearthed County Wexford whilst Fitzgeralds sprang The West. Midlothian solicitors abound who revere Alexander Graham Bell, envy Uncle Same manna because Dr. Albert Einstein turned up abandoned at his door-sill, confide their nation bestowed on General Eisenhower a castle with moat... and golf course. Abigail Adams? "Sorra, you'll need to explicate." (Jaysusgod, and She statured thrice the woman Mary Stuart dreamt upstairs or craved below.) To be sure, Quill, by bent, seldom haunted the academic, bohemian, or clerical ring-around-the-rosy cabals. He muscled his milieu on men-in-commerce, builder-architects, the Military, their wives and/or lemans that tagged along, drunks threatening give-and-take, publicans who slaked them. But still.

Stateside? Same poor show, less amnesty Quill's stricture. The germane verb spells no longer wince; it scans scorn on peers his age or less or more, and some scope wider far. No moral indictment. Nastier: sluggard stance, unstyle. Desuetude yawns for Taps? A balm, an easement, nemine gratia, and [instant gentlemen](#Instant Gentlemen) won't stand attention its Benison once a night, once a death, once a nation? Hale, drones of necropolis! New Bedford blood, Front Royal lymph, spilt all right, stains not your tufted wall-to-wall carpeting. Your Martini runneth over, Sir.

Just so. Rancour prompted the fourteen poems; humbleness before sustained them, such as they be. (Small fibbings? Well, a Kerryman will squander ninety-nine lies to get one fact across.) What burthen they lug? Patently into middle age, he would now decrypt the lode into Quillese, then chance the effluvia at the alter of Merciless Mother English. As he's stared and mulled downside The Angle hardby the clump of trees, between the Codori cote abnd barn, across the Emmitsburg road, past The Swale, into Spangler's Wood he partly pieces together, like a [dhobi](#Dhobi) gathering remnants of a shattered crock and hopelessly findering them, how he, you, and the yearling nation died... and under whose auspices:  
  Abraham Lincoln  
  Robert E. Lee  
  Traveller  
  John Burns  
  Jennie Wren  
  Henry Lee  
  George Meade  
  Arno Kiesewetter  
  Father Corby  
  John Sedgewick  
  Lewis Armistead  
  Ian Farquharson  
  [Ulysses S. Grant](#Grant)  
  Sarah Carter  

Tattoo... Taps. Eyes dry, sweep down Glory's roster again for Domesday's sake. Go ahead, murmur: "But Glory shew on and on -- Wake Island, Bastogne, Tarawa, Huertgen Forest." Other times, other Glories: Glories of stock, Glories in season. Glory of the maples, October's afternoon; Glorious the seared beech, defying December to undress first. Twin Glories: Gettysburg, Guadalcanal... The Glory of life passing into death, the Glory of death passing for life.

Mr. Yeats blasphemed shrewd when he owned up that Sex and Death loomed the two contingencies bloody well worth his bother. Aye, Mr. Yeats. Still, you stem County Sligo gentry; Mike Quill, maker of these sonnets, [septs](#Septs) The [O'Suileabhain](#O'Suileabhain) Kerry fisherfolk. His leaning? Deserving the japer; sex, death, god, pieces o' eight, booze, power. Perhaps he can move on, one day, along more indigenous vein. For now, sex and death. War? Not quite. Gettysburg sums them one.

### The Gettysburg Sequence #1
Epilogue  
(The Gesture Day... November 19, 1863)

Mr. Lincoln catnaps to the anodynous clacking of his [Reading](#Reading) coach, closeing on Gettysburg. He tallies random inward and outward accounts. Does the President graze you a mite sorry for Abe? Well, does not the Son of Man for Jesus, urgeing a gibbet to its ordained rearing?

>Pa [whimped](#Whimped). Ma whored to whelp Abe hedgerow snatch?  
>Mary hugs light to shadow black [Xantipp'](#Xantipp'),  
>The moot-to-matter boys -- his kitchen catch.  
>Least, [dirksome](#Dirksome) friends! He bodes Knight _Lee_ dark trip.  
>(_He's_ sound: one county's brim each man will stand).  
>Not mine, because he loved [Westmoreland](#Westmoreland) more  
>Than [Lincoln's shire](#Lincoln's Shire). Chill God, he's seared a brand  
>Aswash all History that's hapt... foul sore,  
>Ubiquitous as syphilis. To post?  
>Mere _Lee_. _He's_ up to Grant and with his two friends.  
>The sun arcs plane: Abe's sapped, cert as thug Frost  
>Had caned his pipes. Celled pate but turnkey tends.  
>Abe, sugar-plumb the folks. They yearn a fruit.  
>But Springfield mockingbird, he tends thy flute.  

---------------------------------

### The Gettysburg Sequence #2
(The First Day... July 1, 1863)

Robert E. Lee ambles Traveller. The Engineer talks shop and saddle with his sentient engine. The colloquy courses tacit, muted.

Neat, [anabolism](#Anabolism), nibble at the man's fibre... and compounded, two of those three precarious days, by an acute [flux](#Flux); DUTY, as in the past, reports to headquarters. But where intransient ordeal lies doggo to haze, the General will henceforth be taxed over and beyond ITS call. Overload chose noon to weigh in.

Lee speaks:

"Now, no choice but maul the hour. This day? Well, common-sense has written Jackson off. But Stuart? Carlisle's an healthy canter, fetch yesterday. That can abide the [exemplars-to-come](#Exemplars) at West Point... or [Lexington](#Lexington).

First the mete, Brevet Lieutenant Lee: erase Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville -- too lucky, too much Stonewall... and [postures upended](#Postures Upended). (What's more, [Old Whiskers and Fightin' Joe](#Old Whiskers) patently liveried us those twin gory aliments.) Today's algebra? Meade + Sedgewick + stores - Jackson (Have I discounted Stonewall, in truth?), compounded to an escaped power by Stuart = Lee over x. Moot mathematic. And if the tangency disjoin with no [apodosis](#Apodosis)? Well then, Alexander's dread! For five mountain spines and four rivers to west and south, Mr. Lincoln stays his hand with one ace and two jacks showing, and something in the hole. Capt. Lee knows his hand: two kinds showing."

Withal, a good man plumb purest to the Traveller, or [Rover](#Rover), that matches his master... body, heart, and brain.

>I heed [The Snapper](#Snapper), h'm, [Monterey](#Monterey) it was.  
>He miened moot rusy, surfeit stanch. I think,  
>Tight score, we'll squeeze him though. He never does  
>Much quake... less foray 'field. An I claw drink  
>Swish Grant to west (God wits Lee patent can't.)  
>I'd [sough](#Sough) things out the stretch. Or had I had  
>[Light Horse](#Light Horse) spell gadding Jeb, _his_ stores could scant.  
>How deem y' Traveller? Lee's wrought, he's glad,  
>His other self, to mount your splendid side.  
>Since Stonewall fell, y've not once stumbled gait --  
>My trove, trade Jackson's loss. Rain friend, my pride  
>That our [Westmoreland](#Westmoreland) foal the steady trait.  
>I mull Hill, Longstreet, Ewel... puzzles three;  
>I grope: they're mine to fumble with as key.

### The Gettysburg Sequence #3
(The First Day... July 1, 1863)

Auld John Burns, [souter](#Souter), stands ready, wheat to the midriff, sighting west.

>Och, three-score-ten o'rifled, tendin' me!  
>I ken grey gooshin' doon yon green defile  
>I'll size the [pownied](#Pownied) [ghaistie](#Ghaistie), Lee, [th' day](#Th' Day)  
>An' fling thae Cavalier the' sco'ish style  
>Fell [Ulster clans](#Ulster Clans) romp rude, bu' doona frigh'  
>[Ilk](#Ilka) Borders Sco'. Och forbears mine wi' Bruce  
>An' Wallace bled. Di' [pawky](#Pawky) Caesar try  
>T' [hough](#Hough) our [hames an' haughs](#Hames and Haughs)? Na he! The truce  
>He kep', where [Sassunach](#Sassunach) fronts ither shame --  
>Fu' wa' that looms until this awfu' day.  
>'Side me, wee Kerkimer, whose tacit fame  
>Be water he will [tak](#Tak) bricht lad who dee  
>'Ere sun gang doon. Och, aye, _this_ day the [bairns](#Bairn)  
>[Maun](#Maun) keep [hie](#Hie) companie we' cronie Burns.

---------------------------------

### The Gettysburg Sequence #4
(The First Night... July 1, 1863)

[Jennie Wren](#Jennie Wren) reckons ahead. Penelope's story meanders back to woman on earth: by way of The Wife of Bath, Jennie Wren, till Mollie Bloom. It's the way things sort. The fable comes out silly only cecause of the prisses who have laundered it. [When 'Omer smote 'is bloomin' lyre](#When 'Omer), and tacked his lays through the villages and by-ways of Attica, the locals sensed which cheeck his tongue lodged. And blind or not blind, we daresay he knew to wink too.

>Grey gun-butt warns that door; I'll chance him through.  
>Then ream and drain his rifle ball and bore.  
>Johnny minds learn if Jack, or stores, or brew  
>Sequestered be by me. But 'ere cocks chore  
>[He'll blew](#He'll Blew) his booty Jennie's thighs. Jen rut  
>It so. Peaskins, he'll fret Jen's Jack worked west  
>With little [Phil](#Sheridan). I'll bathe her dusty cut  
>His early dew. Last, like a tot, He'll breast.  
>Sleep after wet, what rude rehearsal death!  
>That man of cloth, The Reverend Herman Kraus,  
>Mumbling bedside, shrives shy, matched spent man's breath.  
>In lieu cold Jack, close Johnny warms this house.  
>'Tis sheets north-south... Sunrise, I'll carve him bread.  
>Go gaze men die, weep once, and get me dead.

---------------------------------

### The Gettysburg Sequence #5
(The First Night... July 1, 1863)

Mounted on a sorrel mare, Major [Henry Lee](#Light Horse) reins up along the bedstead in the Lutheran Seminary, Army Headquarters, where his son Robert tussles sleep. (Or do we deem, through an hindsight bestowed, that the Janus-faced prophets, Monk Mendel and Doctor Freud, are honoured once again?)

J. E. B. Stuart's portentious nowhereaboutness has wrought its hobble - the black wool nightmares are woven with. Come daysight, the unfact, the Jeb Stuart fact, roils Robert E. Lee as an _almost_ rational drain on his dwindled neural reserve.

O, the splendid [Anne Carter Lee](#Anne Carter Lee)... a woman to the banner born!

>Exemplar lad, we wit too well _whose_ loin  
>Spasmed that wine-drenched dawn. His shun-hearth wit-  
>Loose vagary slid stallion, doxie, coin.  
>Addlest? Deportment face four kid, twa teat:  
>One ewe to succor ye... whilst blunting ram.  
>That you crag shadeing Launcelot matched men -  
>Broad men that wait - I charge yourself, by damn,  
>And me, false-minting sire, that blades you MAN.  
>Let's sit with hourse. (I've pinked red-coats _that_ trade.)  
>Forget the equine touch and sleep. Spry Jeb,  
>This hour, creaks springs astraddle [Madelaide](#Madelaide)  
>Nigh [Frizzleburg](#Frizzleburg). ('Nent _mounts_, 'twere tensile web  
>_Their_ Buford wove to tip brim to past day.)  
>Blood Carter rinse your brain. Lord, lave Lee's stay.

---------------------------------

### The Gettysburg Sequence #6
(The Second Day... July 2, 1863)

George Gordon Meade strives to be honest with himself and, in his way, toward James Longstreet. He gets up. Dressed to the waist, the General lumbers forth his croft to surprise the sun signalling farside [Red Lion](#Red Lion). This natural spectacle uneases him. He has a _lease_ on the high ground all right, but as celestial prodigies rise, so men have been known to. The man downs his draught of dawn. He repairs to Headquarters, gets gearing behind him, and knuckles down to work. His plotting and placements will resolve in no blameworthy miscalculation. It would take through tomorrow, _owning_ the high ground.

>All right now, Longstreet, lob your dicey hatch.  
>Bollox, trust Meade to botch:-we're merely men,  
>Hence man galore will stand, drop, die to match  
>Our fallibility at noon. Well then?  
>Assault! Mind now, George Meade attends your [best](#Best and Blest);  
>Gone Sundown One, you've skies to squander troops.  
>We falcon high; climb glaze the glint. Lee's [blest](#Best and Blest)  
>May not be up to it so soon. Abe's groups,  
>As his, span downy jowl till patriarch;  
>Twixt them, those pent coitus pends or oils  
>The handy firelock. Approach, absorb its dark  
>Delerium as Eve where Adam soils.  
>The hunter's hunted this 'capade. I'm glad  
>Grey Stonewall's down. Mine's up. Still that thralls sad.





---------------------------------



### Wordstock

Riddles, sobriquets, foreign or densely dialectal terms, coined words, etc. are keyed by _number_ (#) to their incidence throughout The Sequence. For example, PAWKY, canny, wary, Sc. #3. Now, that simply means that the Scottish word _pawky_ occurs in Sonnet #3 (or its attendant prose) and suggests the foregoing familiar-English meanings.

Routine abbreviations are the established ones found in any good English dictionary. To wit: Sc.=Scottish, Path.=Pathology, Intr.=intransitive use of verb, Heb.=Hebrew, and so forth. A few idiosyncratic signals are employed: Q/M=Quillmint (an homemade locution), or T/Y/M/G=Thank you, Mother Goose, etc.

The import of italics is threefold: (1) Conventionally, to convey emphasis and/or affect the flow of diction. (2) To certify a non-English word -- Hindi, Latin, et al. (Exception: Poem #3, built in unabashed "Borders-Scots" inflection). (3) Pronominally, as in #1, where Mr. Lincoln and Gen'l Lee are evoked contrapuntally. The device delines the one man (Mr. Lincoln) from _the other_ (Gen'l. Lee).

The Wordstock swanks no condescension; Quill avowedly surmises, and _respects_, random gaps in a given reader's encyclopaedic inventory. Moreover, let the stateside person allow that a schooled Scots, Irish, Welsh, or English compeer should not be expected to command scope (Lord Charnwood, Sir Winston Churchill, Lt. Gen'l Sir James Marshall-Cornwall excepted) rangeing over persons, places, and contingencies bearing on the conflict broadly and the Gettysburg holocaust in particualr with the grasp of a middle-aged American, high school trained. (The same fetter might well hobble a stateside Ph. D., Soc. of _instant_ vintage.)

<a name="Albanies and Troys"></a>ALBANIES AND TROYS, such Union soldiery as mustered from those two towns and were engaged at Gettysburg. Albany and Troy lie hardby adjacent Massachusets. #9.

<a name="Box-Cars"></a>BOX-CARS, Nomenclature derives from gymkhana _craps_ - rolling the bones, dice. Jakes-agonist flings two sixes (12) first call, he's dead - _box-cars_. (Same is true two aces (2) - _snake-eyes_... Ditto deuce and ace (3) - _cat-eyes_.) Disaster. Amer. #12.

C.); the midshipmen an Annapolis, New London; the goslings at Colorado Springs... with the stress on the _might-have-beens_, partly deduced from analagous arietations. (Quill quotes a portion from a letter, thanks to the kindness of Mrs. Marie T. Capps, Map and Manuscript Librarian at the U. S. Military academy:- "The course to which you referred was at one time called Military Engineering and Strategy. It evolved into Miliary Art and Engineering. It has never had a nickname. At one time the cadets called M. A. & E. and now call it "Art.") #2.

His _elsewhereness_, those three days, pairs as awesomeness Gen'l Thomas Jonathan Jackson's. At tangency? Light for one tenuous filament... BREATH. Whatever Gettysburg wasn't, was _them_. Likewise ominously did Mr. Lincoln and Major Henry Lee cast _their_ vicarious and apposite shadows across the holocaust. Missing Persons Bureau #1. Proem et al.

The 71st Pennsylvania against whom Armistead's Brigade came a cropper were assinged to Hancock's 2nd Corps, and though not physically, _Armistead_ died in _Hancock's_ arms.

<a name="Neap"></a>NEAP, climacteric? stealthy onset declineing vigour.

Firstly: Willougby Run/Appomatox: Thermopylae/Salamis.  
Secondly: The F. F. V.'s strutted The Cavalier, as sure as John Brown harboured rabies. Quill wrenches a thimble-full of related passages from Mr. Robert Penn Warren's astute, terse Meditations, THE LEGACY OF THE CIVIL WAR. (By bloodlines and early surround, his proclivities must be southern.) His first allusion is to the bent of the South's creative minority: "... the apologists offered a philosphy of marmoreal rigidity, proper to the rigidity of that society." And appositely:  
"It did not matter that Theodore Weld, one of the most effective of the Abolitionists, withdrew from active propagandizing because, as he said to an admirer, he found the "he himself needed reforming," and that he "had been laboring to destroy evil in the same spirit as his antagonists." Nor did it matter that Julia Ward Howe, the author-to-be of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," could write in 1858, after a trip to South Carlona: "Moral justice dissents from the habitual sneer, denunciation, and malediction, which have become consecrated forms of piety in speaking of the South." Nor did it matter that Lincoln could take a reasonable tone about John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry: "Old John Brown has been executed for treason against a State. We cannot object, even though he agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong. That cannot excuse violence, bloodshed, and treason. It could avail him nothing that he might think himself right."  
"Despite Theodore Weld and Julia Ward Howe and Abraham Lincoln, love of liberty and lust for blood continued to conspire much self scrutiny or meditation on the social effects of inspired rhetoric."  
"... And a little later it offered space, too, for the folly of Gevernor Wise and his fellow Virginians, who instead of committing John Brown to an asylum, where all the medical ecidence, even then available to the court, clearly indicated that he should be, hanged him and thereby proved again what is never in much need of proof, that a crazy man is a large-scale menace only in a crazy society." Can the man howling in the mob imagine General R. E. Lee, CSA, shaking hands with Orval Faubus, Governor of Arkansas?"  
__Relativity_ is indeed an eerie matter, Dr. Einstein.
